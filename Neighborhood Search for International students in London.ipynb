    "With its world-recognised universities, culturally diverse environment, and highly-skilled academic staff, the UK is consistently increasing in popularity to international students. \n",
    "According to 2018/2019 statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 485,645 international students were pursuing their degree in the UK, of which 125,035 were studying in the capital- `London`. Among other challenges faced by the students, one is selecting a Neighborhood in close vicinity of the Institute, based on their preferences. When I came to London to pursue my masters, I faced the same situation. While there are apps and websites where you can find the nearby postcodes, there is no central repository that specifies what places are there in each of those neighborhoods."
